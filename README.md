# Siemens-forecast

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a monthly sales forecasting model for fourteen product groups within a Business Unit of Siemens' Smart Infrastructure Division. The objective is to provide accurate sales predictions for the period May 2022 â€“ February 2023, leveraging historical sales data and external macroeconomic indicators.

## Methodology

The project follows the CRISP-DM framework and includes:

1. Data Understanding & Preparation: Handling missing values, detecting outliers, and performing statistical tests
2. Feature Selection: Identifying key predictors for each product category
3. Modeling: Testing statistical (ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet) and ML-based models, selecting the best based on RMSE & MAPE
4. Evaluation: Comparing model performance using RMSE and MAPE metrics
5. Deployment: Storing results and selecting the optimal forecasting model per product category
