    "   - Based on the minimum values, we can see that all countries, at some point, there was a decline in production and shipment, as indicated by the values well below 100. This could be due to economic crises or supply chain disruptions (such as semiconductors shortages), etc.\n",

    "Significant decline on November 2018 (decrease of almost 86%). Due to this, the percentage change comparing 2019 to 2018 is also higher. According to Siemens‚Äô Annual Report 2018, there was a significant decline in the Power and Gas Division, which specializes in gas turbines. This might be due to the global shift towards renewable energy. In the same report, we can find that ‚Äú Volume in that segment declined significantly in fiscal 2018 due mainly to customer delays of large projects in the Americas and in the Middle East and strong price pressure resulting from intense competition.‚Äù This could suggest that this product category (#1) is part of th division, although it has not been explicitly confirmed. While we cannot treat this as definitive, it will be taken into account for consideration. The sales in this segment generally range from 35 to 42 million monetary units. October of 2021 had larger sales.\n",

We observed a decrease in sales of approximately 20 millions from 2019 to 2020, which could be attributed to various factors, including the Covid pandemic and the Ukraine war. However, there was a significant increase of almost 36 millions in sales from 2020 to 2021."
